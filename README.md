## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 does your team deserve on this assignment. Revise the assignment grading guideline and assignment rubrics for guidance.

I believe I should get at least a 15/20 at the minimum. I worked on this assignment for quite some time from trying to figure out what was needed for each section as well as taking time to debug. 

## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it?

I found myself struggling with the game logic and controller. I was having difficulty figuring out what I needed to do. I sought out help from my fellow student Jack McHugh and Nick Bell in which they talked me through where I was going wrong and steered me to the correct logic needed for the methods. 


### How long it took us to finish this?
Overall, the assignment took me about 10 hours to complete, with 2 hours on Wednesday night, 5 hours on Thursday night, and 3 hours on Friday night.
